#' Determine non-overlapping clusters

#' Determine non-overlapping clusters from a list of
#' potential clusters.
#' 
#' The function takes a list of potential clusters. Each
#' element of the list contains a potential cluster. The
#' potential clusters are defined by the location indices of
#' the regions comprising the clusters.  Starting with the
#' first potential cluster, the function excludes every
#' potential cluster that intersects the first (any
#' potential cluster that shares indices).  Moving onto the
#' next non-overlapping cluster, the process is repeated. 
#' The function returns the indices (in the list of
#' clusters) of the clusters that do not overlap.
#' 
#' @param x A list containing the potential clusters.
#' @return A vector with the list indices of the 
#'   non-overlapping clusters.
