#' Determine nearest neighbors
#' 
#' \code{nn} determines the nearest neighbors for a set of 
#' observations based on a distance matrix.
#' 
#' This function determine nearest neighbors in two ways: 1.
#' number of neighbors or 2. distance.
#' 
#' If \code{method = "c"}, then \code{k} specifies the total
#' number of neighbors to return for each observation.  
#' 
#' If \code{method = "d"}, then \code{k} specifies the maximum
#' distance for which an observation is considered a 
#' neighbor.  
#' 
#' The function returns the neighbors for each 
#' observation.
#' 
#' @param d A square distance matrix for the 
#'   coordinates of interest.
#' @param k The number of neighbors to return (if 
#'   \code{method = "c"}) or the distance for which 
#'   observations are considered neighbors (if \code{method 
#'   = "d"}).
#' @param method The method of determining the neighbors. 
#'   The default is \code{"c"}, specifying that the \code{k}
#'   nearest neighbors (the number of neighbors) for each 
#'   observation should be returned.  The alternative is 
#'   \code{"d"}, meaning that neighbors are determined by 
#'   their distance from an observation.  In that case, two 
#'   observations are neighbors if their separation distance
#'   is less or equal to \code{k}.
#' @param self A logical indicating whether an observation 
#'   is a neighbor with itself.  The default is 
#'   \code{FALSE}.
#'   
#' @return Returns a list with the nearest neighbors of each
#'   observation. For each element of the list, the indices
#'   order neighbors from nearest to farthest.
