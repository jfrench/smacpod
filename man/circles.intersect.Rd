\title{Determine whether circles intersect}
\usage{
circles.intersect(coords, r)
}
\arguments{
\item{coords}{A matrix of coordinates with the
centroid of each circle.}

\item{r}{A vector containing the radii of the circles. 
The length of \code{r} must equal the number of rows of 
\code{coords}.}
}
\value{
Returns a matrix of logical values indicating
  whether the circles intersect.
}
\description{
\code{circles.intersect} determines whether circles
intersect with each other.
}
\details{
The algorithm is based on the premise that two circles
intersect if, and only if, the distance between their
centroids is between the sum and the difference of their
radii.  I have squared the respective parts of the
inequality in the implemented algorithm.

\examples{
# first two circles intersect each other, 
# the next two circles intersect each other 
# (but not the previous ones)
# the last circles doesn't intersect any other circle
co = cbind(c(1, 2, 5, 6, 9), c(1, 2, 5, 6, 9))
r = c(1.25, 1.25, 1.25, 1.25, 1.25)
# draw circles
circles.plot(co, r)
# confirm intersections
circles.intersect(co, r)

# nested circles (don't intersect)
co = matrix(rep(0, 4), nrow = 2)
r = c(1, 1.5)
circles.plot(co, r)
circles.intersect(co, r)
