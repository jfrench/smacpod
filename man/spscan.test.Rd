\usage{
spscan.test(
  x,
  case = 2,
  nsim = 499,
  alpha = 0.1,
  maxd = NULL,
  cl = NULL,
  longlat = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A \code{\link[spatstat.geom]{ppp}} object with marks for the case
and control groups.}

\item{case}{The position of the name of the "case" group 
in \code{levels(x$marks)}.  The default is 2. 
\code{x$marks} is assumed to be a factor.  Automatic 
conversion is attempted if it is not.}

\item{nsim}{The number of simulations from which to 
compute the p-value.  A non-negative integer.  Default 
is 499.}

\item{alpha}{The significance level to determine whether 
a cluster is signficiant.  Default is 0.1.}

\item{maxd}{The radius of the largest possible cluster to
consider.  Default is \code{NULL}, i.e., no limit.}

\item{cl}{
A cluster object created by \code{\link{makeCluster}},
or an integer to indicate number of child-processes
(integer values are ignored on Windows) for parallel evaluations
(see Details on performance).
}

\item{longlat}{A logical value indicating whether
Euclidean distance (\code{FALSE}) or Great Circle
(WGS84 ellipsoid, \code{FALSE}) should be used. Default
is \code{FALSE}, i.e., Euclidean distance.}
}
\value{
Returns a list of length two of class 
  \code{scan}. The first element (clusters) is a list 
  containing the significant, non-ovlappering clusters, 
  and has the the following components: \item{coords}{The
  centroid of the significant clusters.} \item{r}{The 
  radius of the window of the clusters.} \item{pop}{The 
  total population in the cluser window.} 
  \item{cases}{The observed number of cases in the 
  cluster window.} \item{expected}{The expected number of
  cases in the cluster window.} \item{smr}{Standarized 
  mortaility ratio (observed/expected) in the cluster 
  window.} \item{rr}{Relative risk in the cluster 
  window.} \item{propcases}{Proportion of cases in the 
  cluster window.} \item{loglikrat}{The loglikelihood 
  ratio for the cluster window (i.e., the log of the test
  statistic).} \item{pvalue}{The pvalue of the test 
  statistic associated with the cluster window.} The 
  second element of the list is the centroid coordinates.
  This is needed for plotting purposes.

\description{
\code{spscan.test} performs the spatial scan test of 
Kulldorf (1997) for case/control point data.
}
\details{
The test is performed using the random labeling 
hypothesis.  The windows are circular and extend from the
observed data locations.  The clusters returned are 
non-overlapping, ordered from most significant to least 
significant.  The first cluster is the most likely to be 
a cluster.  If no significant clusters are found, then 
the most likely cluster is returned (along with a 
warning).

Setting \code{cl} to a positive integer MAY speed up 
computations on non-Windows computers.  However, 
parallelization does have overhead cost, and there are 
cases where parallelization results in slower 
computations.

\examples{
data(grave)
out = spscan.test(grave, nsim = 99)
plot(out, chars = c(1, 20), main = "most likely cluster")
# get warning if no significant cluster
out2 = spscan.test(grave, alpha = 0.001, nsim = 99)
