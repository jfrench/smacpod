\title{Determine non-overlapping clusters}
\usage{
noc(x)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A list containing the potential clusters.}
}
\value{
A vector with the list indices of the 
  non-overlapping clusters.
}
\description{
Determine non-overlapping clusters from a list of
potential clusters.
}
\details{
The function takes a list of potential clusters. Each
element of the list contains a potential cluster. The
potential clusters are defined by the location indices of
the regions comprising the clusters.  Starting with the
first potential cluster, the function excludes every
potential cluster that intersects the first (any
potential cluster that shares indices).  Moving onto the
next non-overlapping cluster, the process is repeated. 
The function returns the indices (in the list of
clusters) of the clusters that do not overlap.
